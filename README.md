# CoViz

## CoViz (Corona Virus Visualisation ) is a Web Application written in Python.

### Tip: You can hover over any Graph, to see the details in detail.

### This App consists of 6 Main Sections:

### 1. CURRENT UPDATES : You can find the current Total Cases 

### 2. TOP 10 : You can find the Top 10 Countries with percentages

### 3. NEW CASES : You can view the new Cases added every single day

### 4. PAST PATTERNS : You can analyse the patterns from the past data

### 5. YOUR COUNTRY : You can select your Country & fnd a detailed analysis

### 6. MAP : A Geographical Map Visualisation to get the whole picture 

### I have deliberately not done prediction of the future cases using this data 

### I just hope that this unfortunate situation will end in the very near future.
